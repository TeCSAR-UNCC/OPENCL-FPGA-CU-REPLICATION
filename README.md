This fork contains 4 parts.

1. OpenCL codes of a subset of Xilinx SDAccel benchmark suite version 2017.4 deployed on the AWS EC2 Cloud Xilinx VU9P FPGA. For the original benchmark page along with datasets and libs, refer [here](https://github.com/Xilinx/SDAccel_Examples/tree/2017.4).

2. Optimised version of the above codes(kernel, host and makefile) using compute unit replication optimization run on the same FPGA platform.

3. A Compute Unit replication tool based off Python developed for the project

4. Xilinx FPGA based OpenCL codes ported to run on any GPU.
